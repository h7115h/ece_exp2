2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-17#1 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[2]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin x_reg_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Critical Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin x_trig_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell up_reg_i_2, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) up_reg/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch up_reg cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin up_reg/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 1 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
